ðŸš€ LeetCode Practice â€“ Problem #88: Merge Sorted Array (Java + Python)

Today I solved an essential array problem that frequently appears in coding interviews:
ðŸ§© Merge two sorted arrays in-place using an optimized two-pointer approach.

âœ… Key Highlights:

Language: Java & Python

Time Complexity: O(m + n)

Space Complexity: O(1) â€” No extra space!

Technique: Traverse from the end of both arrays to avoid overwriting values.

ðŸ§  Takeaway: Mastering two-pointer strategies and in-place algorithms is vital for optimizing performance in interviews and real-world applications.
