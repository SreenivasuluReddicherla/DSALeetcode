\# LeetCode 68: Text Justification



\## Problem

Format text such that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters, fully justified.



\## Approach

\- Greedy: Fill as many words as possible per line.

\- Distribute spaces evenly between words.

\- Left-justify last line.



\## Time \& Space Complexity

\- Time: O(n \* L) where n = number of words, L = maxWidth

\- Space: O(1) extra (ignoring output list)



\## Solutions

\- ✅ Java: TextJustification.java

\- ✅ Python: text\_justification.py
