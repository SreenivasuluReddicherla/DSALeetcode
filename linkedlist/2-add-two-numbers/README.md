\# LeetCode 2: Add Two Numbers



\## Problem

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit.

Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.



\## Approach

\- Traverse both linked lists simultaneously.

\- Add corresponding digits along with carry.

\- Create new nodes for each result digit.

\- Continue until both lists and carry are processed.



\## Time \& Space Complexity

\- Time: O(max(m, n)) — where m, n are lengths of the lists

\- Space: O(max(m, n)) — for result list



\## Solutions

\- ✅ Java: AddTwoNumbers.java

\- ✅ Python: add\_two\_numbers.py
