\# LeetCode 21: Merge Two Sorted Lists



\## Problem

Merge two sorted linked lists into one sorted linked list and return its head.



\## Approach

\- Use a dummy node to simplify edge cases.

\- Compare the heads of both lists and attach the smaller one to the result.

\- Continue until one list is empty, then attach the remainder.



\## Time \& Space Complexity

\- Time: O(m + n), where m and n are lengths of the two lists.

\- Space: O(1), iterative approach uses constant extra space.



\## Solutions

\- ✅ Java: MergeTwoSortedLists.java

\- ✅ Python: merge\_two\_sorted\_lists.py
