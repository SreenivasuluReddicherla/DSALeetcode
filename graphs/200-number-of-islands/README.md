\### ðŸ§  Problem Statement

Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid representing a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water),  

return the number of \*\*islands\*\*.



An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically.



---



\### ðŸ’¡ Approach: Depth-First Search (DFS)

\- Traverse each cell in the grid.

\- When `'1'` (land) is found, perform DFS to mark all connected lands as visited.

\- Increment island count each time a new unvisited land is found.



\#### âœ… Steps

1\. Iterate through the entire grid.  

2\. If a cell is `'1'`, trigger a DFS from that cell.  

3\. DFS marks all connected `'1'`s as `'0'`.  

4\. Count the number of DFS calls made â†’ number of islands.

\### ðŸ•’ Time Complexity

\*\*O(m Ã— n)\*\* â€” each cell is visited once.  

\### ðŸ§  Space Complexity

\*\*O(m Ã— n)\*\* â€” recursion stack for DFS (in worst case, all land).
