\# ðŸ§© 133. Clone Graph



\### ðŸ“‚ Folder

`graph/133-clone-graph`



---



\### ðŸ§  Problem Statement

You are given a \*\*reference to a node\*\* in a connected undirected graph.  

Each node has a `val` (integer) and a list of `neighbors`.



Return a \*\*deep copy\*\* (clone) of the graph.



---



\### ðŸ’¡ Approach: BFS with HashMap

We perform a \*\*Breadth-First Search (BFS)\*\* traversal to visit each node once,  

while maintaining a \*\*mapping\*\* from the original node to its clone.



For each node:

1\. Clone it if not already cloned.

2\. Add clones of its neighbors to the current cloneâ€™s neighbor list.

3\. Push unvisited neighbors to the queue.

\### âœ… Steps

1\. Use a \*\*HashMap / Dictionary\*\* to store mapping `{original\_node â†’ cloned\_node}`.

2\. Start BFS from the given node.

3\. Clone each neighbor and connect appropriately.

4\. Return the clone of the original input node.

\### ðŸ•’ Time Complexity

\*\*O(V + E)\*\* â€” where V = number of vertices, E = number of edges.



\### ðŸ§  Space Complexity

\*\*O(V)\*\* â€” for storing cloned nodes and queue.
