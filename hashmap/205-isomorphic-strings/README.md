\# LeetCode 205: Isomorphic Strings



\## Problem

Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in `s` can be replaced to get `t`. Each character must map to one other character, and the mapping must be one-to-one.



\## Approach

\- Use two hash maps for bidirectional character mapping (s → t and t → s).

\- For each character, ensure consistent and injective mapping.



\## Time and Space

\- Time: O(n)

\- Space: O(n)
