\# LeetCode #128: Longest Consecutive Sequence



\## Problem

Given an unsorted array, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.



\## Approach

\- Use a HashSet to check for sequence starts in O(1).

\- Only expand when the current number is a sequence starting point.



\## Time and Space

\- Time: O(n)

\- Space: O(n)
