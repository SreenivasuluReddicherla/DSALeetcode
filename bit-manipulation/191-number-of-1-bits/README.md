\# LeetCode 191: Number of 1 Bits



\## Problem

Return the number of '1' bits in the 32-bit binary representation of a given integer.



\## Approach

\- Use bit manipulation.

\- Brian Kernighan’s algorithm removes the lowest set bit in each step until `n` becomes 0.



\## Time \& Space Complexity

\- Time: O(k), where k = number of set bits

\- Space: O(1)



\## Solutions

\- ✅ Java: NumberOf1Bits.java

\- ✅ Python: number\_of\_1\_bits.py
