\# LeetCode 190: Reverse Bits



\## Problem

Reverse bits of a given 32-bit unsigned integer.



\## Approach

\- Use bitwise operations:

&nbsp; - Extract the least significant bit.

&nbsp; - Append it to result using left shift.

&nbsp; - Shift the input right until all 32 bits are processed.



\## Time \& Space Complexity

\- Time: O(32) = O(1)

\- Space: O(1)



\## Solutions

\- ✅ Java: ReverseBits.java

\- ✅ Python: reverse\_bits.py
