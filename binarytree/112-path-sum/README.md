\# LeetCode 112: Path Sum



\## Problem

Check if a binary tree has a root-to-leaf path with a given sum.



\## Approach

\- \*\*Recursive DFS\*\*: Subtract node values from target until reaching leaf.

\- \*\*Iterative DFS (Stack)\*\*: Track cumulative sum along paths.



\## Time \& Space Complexity

\- Time: O(n) (visit all nodes once)

\- Space: O(h) recursion stack or O(n) stack in worst case



\## Solutions

\- ✅ Java: PathSum.java

\- ✅ Python: path\_sum.py
