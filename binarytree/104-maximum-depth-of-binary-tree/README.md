\# LeetCode 104: Maximum Depth of Binary Tree



\## Problem

Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

Maximum depth = longest path from root to leaf.



\## Approach

\- DFS: Recursively calculate depth of left and right subtrees.

\- BFS: Level-order traversal, count number of levels.



\## Time \& Space Complexity

\- Time: O(n) – each node visited once

\- Space: O(h) – recursion stack (h = height of tree)



\## Solutions

\- ✅ Java: MaximumDepthBinaryTree.java

\- ✅ Python: max\_depth.py
