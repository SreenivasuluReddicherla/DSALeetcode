\# LeetCode 226: Invert Binary Tree



\## Problem

Invert a binary tree by swapping left and right children recursively.



\## Approach

\- Recursively swap left and right subtrees.

\- Alternatively, use BFS/DFS iteration with a queue or stack.



\## Time \& Space Complexity

\- Time: O(n)  (visit all nodes once)

\- Space: O(h) recursion stack, O(n) in worst case (skewed tree)



\## Solutions

\- ✅ Java: InvertBinaryTree.java

\- ✅ Python: invert\_binary\_tree.py
