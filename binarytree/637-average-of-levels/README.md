\# LeetCode 637: Average of Levels in Binary Tree



\## Problem

Return the average value of nodes at each level of the binary tree.



\## Approach

\- Perform BFS using a queue.

\- At each level, compute sum of nodes and divide by number of nodes.

\- Store averages in a result list.



\## Time \& Space Complexity

\- Time: O(n) (visit each node once)

\- Space: O(n) (queue in worst case)



\## Solutions

\- ✅ Java: AverageOfLevels.java

\- ✅ Python: average\_of\_levels.py
